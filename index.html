					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<p>Regional Intergovernmental Organizations (RIGOs) are constituted by the local governments within their respective regions and are supported by the active engagement of the regionâ€™s community and citizens. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), on the other hand, are classified by the federal government based on commuting and commerce patterns. They do not adhere to any local government. The Graduate School of Policy and International Affairs Center for Metropolitan Studies (GSPIA) at the University of Pittsburgh have been researching the boundaries of RIGOs and the characteristics defining them. In this paper, we propose, design, and implement an approach to enhance the current visualization by visualizing two categorical data: RIGOs and MSAs and the overlapping between them. We attempted to use a combination of visual attributes that leverage human perception system and do not impose cognitive and mental effort. The overall result of the evaluation shows that our work proved to be more effective than the current visualization.</p>
